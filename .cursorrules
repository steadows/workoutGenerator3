# GSD (Get Shit Done) Protocol
1. **Discuss**: Always analyze the file structure and requirements before coding.
2. **Plan**: Maintain a `PLAN.md` file. It is the Source of Truth.
3. **Execute**: 
   - Read `PLAN.md`.
   - Pick the first [ ] TODO task.
   - Implement it.
   - Mark it [x] DONE.
   - STOP. Do not do two tasks at once.
